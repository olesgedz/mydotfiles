# norminette-linter package

A linter for the 42 school norm.

##### Some settings are present:
 - change extensions that the linter will check.
 - change the executable path to the `42 norminette binary`.

#### warning !

To be able to use this `linter` you'll need to
`install` the [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) package first.

Thanks to `@dtortera` for the help !
